**About Password Generator**
Nowadays security is the most important thing while working on a system. 
To keep a system secure on user-level one should use highly protective passwords. 
By protective passwords, it means that one should not use any predictive things like your date of birth, name, surname, etc.

Then the question arises what should we use? 
We should use a random password generating application so that no one could guess and misuse the password we have set.
Now let us create a password generating application using python.

**Python Password Generator Project Details**
While creating the Password Generator, we will be using the Tkinter Module to create an easy GUI window and adding necessary fields to it.
For generating the password we will be using the random module so that a random password is generated by choosing words from a string that we will specify.
We are generating a password randomly so that it is secure to use.

**Prerequisites for Password Generator using Python**
To proceed with the project, you need the following :

Understanding of the basic concept of python.
Install Tkinter Module – For creating the GUI in python.
Pip install tk
Install Random Module – For generating Random Number
Pip install random
